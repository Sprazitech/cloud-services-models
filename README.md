# Cloud Service Providers and Models.

**Identify examples of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS from your daily interactions**

**1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

Example: AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

When you spin up a virtual machine (VM) on AWS, you’re using IaaS.
It gives you raw infrastructure like servers, storage, and networking, but you manage the OS and apps.

Other Examples:

Google Compute Engine (GCE).
Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines.


**2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

Example: Heroku

If you deploy an app on Heroku, you don’t worry about managing servers, just your code.
It handles the infrastructure, runtime, and scaling for you.

Other Examples:

AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Google App Engine.
Microsoft Azure App Services.


**3. Software as a Service (SaaS).**

Example: Gmail.

You don’t need to install or maintain an email server—just log in and use it.
Google manages everything (storage, security, updates).

Other Examples:

Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel online).
Dropbox (Cloud Storage).
Netflix (Streaming Service).

**3. Set up a managed service like AWS Elastic Beanstalk** 

When i tried setting up my AWS Elstic Beanstalk, I discovered that my Sandbox don't have the authorization to set up AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
